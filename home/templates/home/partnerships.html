          <h3>About</h3>
        <p>The Applicable Mathematics Society strives to prepare its members with the mathematical
            knowledge they are going to need in the real world. This ranges from preparing students
            for internships, jobs, or even graduate school. Primarily, we focus on maths not traditionally
            taught at the LSE along with holding sessions that teach our members computer programs.
            The focus of the club from year to year is largely determined by the
            make up of the society at that given point in time.</p>
