          <h3>About</h3>
        <p>The Applicable Mathematics Society strives to prepare its members with the mathematical
            knowledge they are going to need in the real world. This ranges from preparing students
            for internships, jobs, or even graduate school. Primarily, we focus on maths not traditionally
            taught at the LSE along with holding sessions that teach our members computer programs.
            The focus of the club from year to year is largely determined by the
            make up of the society at that given point in time.</p>

        <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The Investment Society was founded in 2003 to build the knowledge and skills of our members, enabling
                them to realise their potential and career ambitions in the areas of investment and finance. Since its
                founding, the Investment Society has grown to become one of the largest and most active societies at the
                LSE and is incredibly proud of its legacy. We have been fortunate enough to be supported by a diverse
                and growing sponsorship base, critical at driving our operations.

        <h3>About</h3>
            <p>UCL Financial Industry Series, or more commonly known as UCL FINDS is a student-run forum that organises high-impact conferences,
            debates and talks on financial topics. We were founded in December 2010 with the purpose of providing students, and professionals
            alike, with the opportunity to look into the latest topics within the financial industry. Attendees can not only develop a
            comprehensive understanding of the field but also benefit from unique networking opportunities.
